Here are some of my projects that showcase my data science skills in R and Python.

## Locating Long Polling Lines with Twitter Data 🍕🗳️🇺🇸

This project locates polling locations with long polling lines in the United States by mining tweets posted by [Pizza to the Polls](https://polls.pizza/), a nonprofit organization that receives reports of long polling lines and sends pizzas. The data is for 2018 Midterm Election. I use negative binomial regression and propensity score to investigate which congressional districts were most likely to contact Pizza to the Polls and extract what lessons Pizza to the Polls could learn from the data to improve its outreach for the 2020 General Election.

[Github](https://github.com/amikami102/clv_widget) / [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/amikami102/clv_widget/blob/master/DSexercise_v8.ipynb)

This is a data science challenge submitted as part of job application to a data scientist position. The challenge was to analyze and predict customer lifetime value from purchase history data from an ecommerce store that sells widgets with a Python package called [`lifetimes`](https://lifetimes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Quickstart.html).
