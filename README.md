# Locating Long Polling Lines with Twitter Data

[Github](https://github.com/amikami102/pizza_to_the_polls) / [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/afmikami/pizza_to_the_polls) / [RShiny app](https://asakomikami.shinyapps.io/pizza_to_the_polls/)

This project locates polling locations with long polling lines in the United States by mining tweets posted by Pizza to the Polls, a nonprofit organization that receives reports of long polling lines and sends pizzas. The data is for 2018 Midterm Election. I use negative binomial regression and propensity score to investigate which congressional districts were most likely to contact Pizza to the Polls and extract what lessons Pizza to the Polls could learn from the data to improve its outreach for the 2020 General Election.
